# Gantt Chart Creator
An html based Gantt chart creator using the [timeline vis javascript library](http://visjs.org/docs/timeline/) and [papaparse javascript library](http://papaparse.com/).

The aim of this tool is to enable creation of Gantt Chart by providing start and end dates for each task in plain text separated by comma.

Alternatively, a simple copy paste of excel columns into the textarea will also provide desired result.

The current interface does make use of the flexibility offered by vis timeline library to customise the look and feel of Gantt Chart by providing custom css. The sample data and sample custom css will help user to understand what to modify and how.
